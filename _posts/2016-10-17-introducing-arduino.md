For about 6 months now I've been following the progress of [Ardunio](https://www.arduino.cc/) which is a rapid prototying tool for your electronics ideas. It's a sort of way of joining the software world  with the physical, tangible world. 

[Ardunio](https://www.arduino.cc/) describes itself as "an open-source electronics platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software."

As someone who has been involved in software I've always had an interest in joining these two worlds. Will it be art, an invention or simply a thing? 

The main attraction for me is the now easy availability of starter kits. Some clever people are producing packs available all over the web including Amazon featuring a plethora of different parts and projects. If it was really this easy I could not resist any longer.

Not having a clue what I was doing (well I at least checked the [Ardunio Subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/arduino) for tips on starting out) I went ahead and ordered [this starter kit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009UKZV0A/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

This comes with a decent easy to understand manual (RTFM!) which 

- Walks you through the basics of Arduino and electronics in a hands-on way
- Will help me build 15 projects using components that let me control the physical world through different kinds of sensors and actuators.
- Includes over 100 components

Personally I can't wait to get stuck in. Hopefully I'll have something decent to show on here soon.

For now here is a picture of the Arduino Microcontroller board at the heart of the pack.

<h1>About Neil</h1>

<p>I'm a web developer with 15 years experience. I'm based in the rural town of Otley, which is North Leeds. </p>
 
<p>My first web development job was for London Agency <a href="https://www.tui.co.uk" target="_blank">www.tui.co.uk</a> back in 2000. Back then, clients we're BT, The Halifax and Asda. The web was fresh, new and exiting. I learned my trade here and focussed on the backend with PHP and MySql. </p>
 
<p>Since then I've built many projects ranging from small brochure sites to full blown content management systems for global brands like Wagamama. I've been a senior developer a number of agencies including <a href="http://www.engageinteractive.co.uk" target="_blank">engageinteractive.co.uk</a> who are based in Leeds and work as a consultant and developer on a freelance basis for <a href="www.hypetype.co.uk" target="_blank">hypetype.co.uk</a> (Los Angeles), <a href="http://www.hellolovestudio.com/">hellolovestudio.com</a> (London), <a href="http://humaan.com" target="_blank">humaan.com</a> (Perth, Australia), <a href="http://bluestone98.com" target="_blank">bluestone98.com</a>, <a href="http://madebytall.co.uk" target="_blank">madebytall.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://zeppocreative.com" target="_blank">zeppocreative.com</a>. 
 
<p>I've been involved in all aspects of project development from planning through to development, deployment and performance tweaking. I'm as happy in the back end as I am in the front end. At one company I was called 'head of digital' although that seemed all a little too over the top for me. </p>
 
<p>I'm comfortable with most aspects of web development. I offer full stack development, in Ruby (Ruby on Rails) / PHP (Custom / Magento / Wordpress) and front end work CSS (Sass, Less) / HTML5 / Javascript (Jquery / Backbone) and all work is fully responsive. I'm also experienced at writing a technical spec and pitching. </p>
 
<p>I'm currently interested in Javascript heavy frameworks like react.js and angular.js but I'm not sure which one I'm going to concentrate on yet. </p>
 
<p>After having the last 6 months off here are some sites I worked on last year</p>
